### üìÑ WBS Rationale

This WBS follows a logical website development lifecycle with clear phase separation. Planning lays the groundwork for stakeholder alignment. Design tasks ensure the UI is approved before development begins. Development is split into front and back-end deliverables. Testing captures quality assurance before launch. Post-deployment, the project includes ongoing monitoring and iteration. This structure assumes a solo or small team with an expected 4‚Äì6 week timeline.
