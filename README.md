## Assignment Components

### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 
[View the detailed Work Breakdown Structure](./WBS.md)

#### Decompose Your Project
- Break your project into phases, deliverables, and tasks
- Each task should be specific and actionable

#### Format & Labeling
- Present your WBS in a hierarchical format (e.g., a tree diagram or outline)
- Clearly label all levels:
  - Level 1: Phase
  - Level 2: Deliverable
  - Level 3: Task

#### Documentation
Provide a written explanation (1-2 paragraphs) describing:
- The rationale behind your task grouping
- Any assumptions made
- Key deliverables or milestones

### 2. Gantt Chart

#### Task Scheduling
- Translate the tasks from your WBS into a timed schedule
- Estimate start and end dates (or durations) for each task

#### Dependencies & Milestones
- Identify which tasks are dependent on the completion of others
- Highlight critical milestones (e.g., project phase transitions, major deliverables)

#### Visual Representation
- You may use tools like:
  - Microsoft Project
  - Excel
  - Google Sheets
  - Trello with extensions
  - Specialized Gantt software (e.g., TeamGantt, Smartsheet)
- Ensure your chart is readable (labels, timelines, progress bars)
